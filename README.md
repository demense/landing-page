# The Odin Project - Landing Page

This is my attempt to do [Project: Landing Page on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). This project helped me improve me coding skills by building a realistic project. 

- Live Site URL: (https://demense.github.io/landing-page/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://www.fonts.google.com) - This is where I got the font I used.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
